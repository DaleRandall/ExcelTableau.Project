# Excel & Table Assignment
## Top 20 GDP

I was given a task to work with data in Excel, which involved adding a password to the data sheet, formatting the columns, creating a table, and creating a bar chart. I also edited the X and Y axis, moved the bar chart to a new sheet, and edited and colored it. In addition, I added a macro to the bar chart. Furthermore, I went above and beyond by creating a visual for the color blind on the table, showing the Top 20 GBP. This shows I possess advanced Excel skills and attention to detail, and are able to produce high-quality work that meets the needs of diverse audiences.
